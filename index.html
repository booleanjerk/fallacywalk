  <h1>Fallacious Walk</h1>
  <p>The cyberpunk city buzzed with electric energy, neon lights casting shifting hues across rain-slicked streets. Towering skyscrapers pierced the smoggy skyline, their holoscreens flashing ads for cybernetic enhancements and virtual escapes. Petunia navigated the chaotic streets, her LED-trimmed jacket glowing faintly as drones zipped overhead. Vendors hawked glowing noodles and chrome trinkets, their stalls humming with activity. The crowd was a mosaic of augmented humanity—mechanical limbs, luminous eyes, and flickering digital tattoos. Holographic performers dazzled passersby with light shows and fiery illusions. Petunia paused, immersed in the vibrant symphony of technology, progress, and the boundless life of the future.</p>

The vendor, a wiry man with glowing circuitry tattoos, leaned forward.<br><br>\n\n\"Thinking of the noodles, huh? But let me tell you, the real problem isn’t hunger—it’s the sky drones,\" he said, gesturing wildly above.<br>\n\nPetunia blinked. \"I just wanted some noodles.\"<br><br>\n\n\"Sure, but those drones, they’re watching everything! Did you know they can predict what you'll eat next? Forget the noodles; you should think about protecting your data.\"<br><br>\n\nConfused, Petunia stepped back as the man rambled, his noodle pitch lost in a web of unrelated warnings.","options":[{"text":"Red Herring","outcome":"Yes!

The seller, a woman with a cybernetic jaw that glinted under the neon light, greeted her with a sharp grin.<br><br>\n\n\"Looking for upgrades?\" the woman asked, holding up a chrome-plated neural link. \"This could change your life.\"<br><br>\n\nPetunia hesitated. \"I’m just browsing, thanks.\"<br><br>\n\nThe woman leaned closer. \"Listen, you’re either improving yourself or falling behind. This city eats up the weak. Without enhancements, you’re nothing—just another relic of a forgotten era.\"<br><br>\n\nPetunia frowned. \"Isn’t there a middle ground?\"<br><br>\n\n\"There’s no middle ground,\" the woman said firmly, her jaw’s servos whirring. \"You evolve, or you get left in the dust.\"<br><br>\n\nPetunia shook her head, retreating from the oppressive dichotomy as the woman turned back to her glowing wares, certain in her stark worldview.","options":[{"text":"Post Hoc","outcome":"Did the woman assume causation because one event follows another?

Among the stalls, a tall man with a cybernetic monocle waved her over to his setup, a table cluttered with glowing data chips and vintage tech.<br><br>\n\n\"Curious about the chips?\" he asked, grinning.<br><br>\n\n\"Not really,\" Petunia replied. \"I’m just exploring. I’m not into buying random tech I don’t need.\"<br><br>\n\nThe man raised an eyebrow, his grin turning smug. \"Oh, so you’re one of those ‘purists’ who think tech is evil and humanity should go back to the Stone Age? Living in denial while the rest of us embrace progress?\"<br><br>\n\nPetunia blinked. \"That’s not what I said. I just don’t need any of this right now.\"<br><br>\n\n\"Right, because clearly, rejecting tech is so enlightened,\" he scoffed, holding up a glowing chip. \"I bet you’d be the first to panic if your implants stopped working.\"<br><br>\n\nPetunia sighed, realizing the man wasn’t interested in understanding her, only in twisting her words to make his argument. She turned away, leaving him to mutter about \"anti-tech dreamers\" to the next passerby.","options":[{"text":"Straw Man","outcome":"Yes!

Beside her, a man with a holographic tie leaned over conspiratorially.<br><br>\n\n“You ever notice how the city’s gotten worse since they installed those new plasma streetlights?” he asked, his voice low but intense.<br><br>\n\nPetunia raised an eyebrow. “Worse how?”<br><br>\n\n“Crime, chaos, everything! The plasma lights go up, and boom—crime skyrockets. It’s obvious, isn’t it? Those lights are messing with people’s heads.”<br><br>\n\nPetunia frowned. “Or maybe it’s unrelated. The city’s issues could be from economic problems or corporate layoffs.”<br><br>\n\nHe shook his head vehemently. “No, no, it’s the lights. I mean, the timing lines up perfectly. You can’t argue with facts.”<br><br>\n\nPetunia sighed, turning back to her drink. The man continued ranting about “mind-warping lights,” oblivious to the flaws in his logic.","options":[{"text":"Tu Quoque","outcome":"Did the man dismiss an argument by accusing the speaker of hypocrisy?

A street preacher with glowing cybernetic arms stood on a makeshift podium, shouting about the dangers of tech dependency.<br><br>\n\n“You there!” he called out, pointing directly at her. “Don’t let this city’s tech poison your soul. Augmentations weaken the human spirit!”<br><br>\n\nPetunia tilted her head, glancing at his glowing arms. “You’re using augments yourself,” she replied, gesturing toward the intricate cybernetics.<br><br>\n\nThe man smirked. “I use them to fight the system. What’s your excuse? Don’t turn this on me.”<br><br>\n\n“I’m not the one preaching against tech while covered in it.”<br><br>\n\n“Typical deflection,” he shot back. “Just admit you’re part of the problem instead of pointing fingers.”<br><br>\n\nPetunia sighed, realizing he wasn’t interested in addressing his own contradictions. Instead, his words twisted her observation into an attack, sidestepping the actual argument altogether.","options":[{"text":"Tu Quoque","outcome":"Yes!

Beside her, a man with a head-mounted holo-display was passionately arguing with a group of curious onlookers.<br><br>\n\n“You think those new memory chips are harmless?” he said, waving a small glowing implant. “First, it’s better recall for your grocery list. Next, it’s tracking your thoughts. Then—bam!—the corporations own your mind.”<br><br>\n\nPetunia, intrigued, stepped closer. “That seems like a big leap. Aren’t these chips just tools?”<br><br>\n\n“That’s how it starts!” he exclaimed, pointing at her. “One chip leads to another. Before you know it, they’ll have neural overrides. You’ll be walking around, doing their bidding, thinking it’s your own idea.”<br><br>\n\nPetunia frowned. “But that’s not what these chips do.”<br><br>\n\n“Not yet!” he shouted. “But mark my words, you install one of these, and you’ll be a corporate drone by the end of the decade.”<br><br>\n\nPetunia shook her head and stepped away, his catastrophic vision spiraling far beyond the technology at hand. The vending machine behind her hummed quietly, unconcerned by the apocalyptic rant.","options":[{"text":"Ad Hominem","outcome":""},{"text":"Slippery Slope","outcome":"Yes!

A polished man in a white coat, his badge reading “Dr. Orlan—NeuroTech Consultant,” intercepted her near a display of glowing neural implants.<br><br>\n\n“Thinking about enhancing your cognitive abilities?” he asked with a practiced smile.<br><br>\n\n“I’m just looking,” Petunia replied, examining a small chip labeled Memory Boost V3.<br><br>\n\n“Well, Dr. Astrid—she’s the leading expert in cognitive augmentations—swears by these implants,” he said, gesturing to the display. “She’s published dozens of papers on how they revolutionize human thought. You can’t argue with her credentials.”<br><br>\n\nPetunia hesitated. “But do they have side effects? What about long-term risks?”<br><br>\n\n“Dr. Astrid says they’re completely safe,” he insisted, leaning closer. “She’s a genius, after all. If she endorses them, there’s no reason to question it.”<br><br>\n\nPetunia nodded politely but stepped away, unconvinced. It seemed like he leaned more on Dr. Astrid’s authority than providing actual answers. The glow of the implants felt dimmer as she walked out, her questions still unanswered.","options":[{"text":"Appeal to Authority","outcome":"Yes!

At a stall selling sleek, glowing wrist mods, she paused to admire the craftsmanship.<br><br>\n\nBehind the counter, a woman with violet-tinted cybernetic eyes smirked. “Thinking of upgrading? Or are you just window-shopping like the rest of the cheapskates?”<br><br>\n\nPetunia raised an eyebrow. “I’m curious about how these mods work.”\n\nThe woman crossed her arms, her smirk twisting into a sneer. “Figures. Someone like you probably couldn’t even handle them. Let me guess—you think you’re too ‘pure’ for tech, or are you just too broke to buy anything worthwhile?”<br><br>\n\nPetunia’s expression hardened. “I was just asking a question. No need to make it personal.”\n\n“Personal?” the vendor scoffed, leaning forward. “You walk in here like you’re some kind of expert, but you don’t even know what you’re looking at. People like you waste my time.”<br><br>\n\nPetunia stepped back, her curiosity replaced with irritation. The woman’s sharp words weren’t about her question—they were a calculated jab at her character, designed to end the conversation before it began. With a sigh, she turned and melted back into the market’s neon glow.","options":[{"text":"Slippery Slope","outcome":"Did anyone argue that one step will inevitably lead to extreme outcomes?

She found herself drawn to a rooftop lounge bathed in soft, ambient neon hues. A small sign read: \"The Skylight: Where Stories Meet Stars.\"<br><br>\n\nInside, the atmosphere was warm, almost serene. People chatted and laughed, sharing tales of triumph and struggle under the comforting hum of soft music. A kind server greeted her with a genuine smile and offered a menu filled with whimsical synth-pressos and glowing desserts.<br><br>\n\nPetunia ordered a drink called Aurora’s Whisper, its liquid swirling with luminous colors. As she sipped, a musician with a cybernetic arm began to play an ethereal tune on a sleek, holographic instrument. The notes floated through the air like magic, weaving a calming spell over the room.<br><br>\n\nA group at a nearby table invited her to join them. They were travelers, like herself, exploring the city’s strange beauty. The conversation flowed easily—stories of wonder, laughter, and shared discoveries.<br><br>\n\nFor the first time that night, Petunia felt at peace. The city was chaotic, yes, but it was also vibrant, filled with endless possibilities. She smiled, raising her glass to the future.","options":[{"text":"Thanks Petunia","outcome":"I hope you can identify informal logical fallacies now! :)"}]}];
